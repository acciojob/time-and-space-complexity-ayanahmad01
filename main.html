	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that 
		measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time 
		it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It 
		characterizes how the execution time of an algorithm grows 
		relative to the size of the input. Efficient algorithms possess 
		low time complexity, implying that their execution time increases 
		moderately even as the input size expands. In contrast, algorithms 
		with high time complexity become progressively slower with larger 
		inputs, often rendering them impractical for real-world applications. 
		Time complexity analysis aids in identifying the most optimal algorithms 
		for solving specific problems, enabling programmers to make informed 
		choices to achieve faster and more responsive software systems.

		<b>Space complexity</b> is a fundamental concept in computer science that 
		evaluates the memory resources an algorithm requires to execute as 
		a function of the input size. It measures the amount of memory, 
		typically in terms of storage cells or memory units, that an algorithm 
		uses during its operation. The notation "O(n)" is often employed to 
		describe space complexity, where "n" represents the input size. This 
		indicates that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with 
		the input size. In other words, as the input size increases, the memory 
		consumption of the algorithm increases proportionally. Space-efficient 
		algorithms aim to minimize this growth, allowing programs to handle larger 
		inputs without straining memory resources. Analyzing space complexity is 
		vital for designing algorithms that optimize memory usage, leading to 
		more scalable and efficient software solutions.
